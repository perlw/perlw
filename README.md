# perlw

`perlw` is a monolithic service installed on the current revision of `the_universe`.
The service is in it's fourth major revision.

## Motivation

The service is built on the principles of [https://handmade.network/](Handmade Network) and [https://indieweb.org/](Indieweb).
It's primarily driven by an intense need to _exploring by doing_ and as such attempts to do everything on it's own and from scratch.
This has meant exploring ways to create a minimal GitHub-webhook enabled CI "system", building and using it's own http proxy system,
managing a VPS using GitHub actions to deploy docker images, dreaming about building Yet-Another-Game-Engine (primarily for personal use of course),
and an attempt to build a personal web-gallery of game screenshots.

There's also been a longstanding urge to explore and learn more about memory and performance efficient code, where which there's
always much more to learn.
